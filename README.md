# HiddenGemsUSA / StartHere
HiddenGemsUSA programming mentoship project, start here (onboarding)


Welcome. We're looking to find an mentor young people to develop skills and/or careers in computer programming.

## What is a "Hidden Gem"?
What is a "Hidden Gem"?

### "Gem"
First, let's define a "gem". A gem is as a young person who has (1) high aptitude and (2) high motivation to learn programming. You have to have both to be a gem. So that means:
1. It's not enough to just be smart. Smart and lazy/unmotivated/over-scheduled would mean you're not a gem.
2. It's not enough to be motivated. If you work hard but don't have aptitude, you won't be a gem.

The good news: you don't have to be a gem at the beginning. People don't know where they fit until they try it.
- We work with you to figure out if you have aptitude and motivation. It takes about 1-3 months to figure it out. After that evalution period, we'll know if you're in 1 of 4 categories:
  - HIGH APTITUDE + HIGH MOTIVATION => you're a gem. We want to encourage you and give you the tools to succeed. Since you want to work hard, we will push/guide you and you willl go fast. (Guess: this is 0.05%-5% of people. **Most rare!**)
  - LOWER APTITUDE + HIGH MOTIVATION => you will work hard, at that matters a lot. We will encourage you and allow you to work at your own pace. (Guess: this is ~5% of people.)
  - HIGH APTITUDE + LOW MOTIVATION => you're smart, but you don't work hard. If you want to stick around, you can. But we won't push you. And if you get stuck in your learning, the help you get is mostly self-service. (Guess: this is ~20% of people.)
  - LOWER APTITUDE + LOW MOTIVATION => you won't work hard on learning programming. And learning programming does require determination. We wish you well in your other endeavors. (Guess: this is ~80% of people.)

### "Hidden" + "Gems"
> "Talent is equally distributed; opportunity is not" [link](https://www.inc.com/thomas-koulopoulos/a-study-of-one-million-inventors-identified-key-to-success-its-not-talent.html)

Ask yourself: How many "Lost Einsteins" are there?

The idea of Lost Einsteins is that society doesn't give everyone an equal opportunity to be an Einstein. If we did, we'd have more black Einsteins, more latinX Einstiens, more women Einsteins, etc. But for people who grow up poorer or lower-class or under cultural bias, it's likely you won't be exposed to math and science in the same way. [^Ramunajan]

"Hidden" means that they aren't given the opportunity. If only they would have been given the opportunity, they would have thrived. In other words:
- HIGH APTITUDE + HIGH MOTIVATION + NO OPPORTUNITY = undiscovered
  - AKA "lost Einstein"
- HIGH APTITUDE + HIGH MOTIVATION + OPPORTUNITY = excellence unleashed

So Hidden Gems is about providing that opportunity. It's about finding those who could be "lost einsteins" and making sure they don't get lost.

### Why programming?
Programming has a number of excellent features:
1) Programming is predominantly objective. Either the code works or it doesn't.
2) Programming provides instant feedback. You can check if your code works or not.
3) Programming and programming related careers are plentiful and lucrative.
4) Programming doesn't require expensive equipment. 
  a) 99% of it can be done on any computer, including a sub-$100 chromebook.
  b) There are no expensive books. All the documentation is online, including youtube and stackoverflow.
6) Programming is not luck based. You have to understand the code.
7) Progress in programming is based on effort. No effort, no progress.
8) Programming teaches good life skills: troubleshooting, endurance, systematic thinking, continuous learning, and learning how to learn.

If programming is so great, why don't more people do it?
1) Programming is hard, even for experienced programmers. But it does get easier over time.
2) It's easy to get stuck on a programming problem and give up. Learning programming requires _endurance_.

#### Comparison to learning an instrument or a sport.
In many ways, learning programming is like learning to play the piano or another instrument, or a sport.
1) Most people who practice long enough can get decently good.
2) Once you get good, it gets easier.
3) Getting good takes lots of practice.
4) Small incremental improvements take increasingly longer times.
5) It's easy to get stuck and give up.
6) Often people give up, because it's too hard, but also if it isn't a priority in their life.

  ```python
  a) Absolute beginner -> simple songs/games/tasks = 1 month.
  b) simple songs/games/tasks  -> okay = +3 months.
  c) okay -> good = +15-20 months.
  d) good -> great = +40 months or not possible for everyone.
  e) great -> world class = +120 months or not possible for everyone. 
  ```

### What's different about Hidden Gems USA vs other programming camps or enrichment programs?

1. **Free.** Hidden Gems USA is 100% free. We will never charge you if you are a hidden gem.
2. **Multi-year support.** It will take several years to become "great". Other programs focus on short term (1 week to 1 semester).
4. **Small group focus.** We focus on getting a small number of hidden gems to "great". Other programs may focus on getting a large number of students to okay.
5. **Intense.** Hidden Gems USA Hidden Gems USA is meant to be the main focus of the student outside of school, or at least one of the Top 3. If the student has too many outside focuses, Hidden Gems USA will not be a good fit.
6. **Outside barriers addressed.** We are aware of complex outside barriers to learning and how to address them. We provide whatever is needed. This would include computers, but also extends to transportation, babysitting, nutrition, etc. Other programs might focus only on the content, but not these outside barriers.

[^Ramunajan]: S Ramunajan is just one example of a hidden gem that made it, despite the odds. In the 1900's, this self-taught Indian of humble means ended up making deep math discoveries that [exceeded the most talented mathematicians in Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan#Mathematicians'_views_of_Ramanujan). "...had he been introduced to modern ideas and methods at sixteen instead of at twenty-six. It is not extravagant to suppose that he might have become the greatest mathematician of his time."
